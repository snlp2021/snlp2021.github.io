(there will be only some minor changes this semsester).

## Course description

This course is a practical, broad and fast-paced introduction
to Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The course covers a variety of machine learning techniques
and their applications in NLP and computational linguistics.

This is a 9ECTS course compulsory for the BA studies in
the [International Studies in Computational Linguistics](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/134560) (ISCL).
Master's students can take the course as a "Hauptseminar"
